                   Heimdall acts as a gatekeeper between UI and the underlying Security frameworks, offering
                   tools for encryption/decryption, as well as signing/verifying.

                   Heimdall supports both using a RSA public-private key-pair, as well as just a public key,
                   which allows for multiple parties to verify and encrypt messages for sending.
